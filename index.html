title: Knight-Mozilla OpenNews--Building an ecosystem for open web development in journalism
---

 <header class="opengraph article_body">
                <h2>Building a news ecosystem on the open web</h2>
                <p>What is OpenNews? Knight-Mozilla OpenNews is about helping journalism thrive on the open web. It's about producing next-generation web solutions that solve real problems in news. It's about supporting communities of developers and journalists as they make, learn and invent together. And it's about deploying fellows&mdash;and code&mdash;into news organizations to collaborate and innovate in new ways. 

<p>In 2011, the Knight-Mozilla News Technology Partnership <a href="http://sinker.tumblr.com/post/12326527709/knight-mozilla-fellows">placed fellows</a> in some of the world's best newsrooms, hosted <a href="http://thornet.wordpress.com/2011/05/27/mojo-jams/">news innovation meetups</a> around the globe and brought a journalism focus to the <a href="http://sinker.tumblr.com/post/12362832820/journalism-at-the-mozilla-festival-saturday">Mozilla Festival</a> in London.

<p>For 2012, the Knight-Mozilla Partnership evolves into Knight-Mozilla OpenNews. Here's how it's growing:</p>

             <h2>Fellowships</h2>
            <p>Our new class of 2012/13 Knight-Mozilla Fellows will be embedded in partner newsrooms around the world to spend a year writing code in collaboration with reporters and newsroom developers. Fellows work in the open by sharing their code and their discoveries on the web, to increase access to better software and ideas.</p>
            <h2>Hackdays</h2>
            <p>This year we'll be sponsoring more than a dozen hackdays to write code that helps to solve real-world journalistic problems. From Africa to the Americas, we're looking for partners to hack the news with us.</p>
            <h2>Learning Labs</h2>
            <p>Launching this spring, we'll be hosting online seminars, tutorials, and full-fledged classes tuned to offer new skills to highly-skilled developers and new-to-code journalists&mdash;as well as points in between.</p>
            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>The hacker-journalist community is a vibrant one, and all our initiatives are designed to help it grow in size as well as strength. Later this year, we'll be launching <i>Source</i>, a new site that highlights the best code (and coders) in the community.</p>
