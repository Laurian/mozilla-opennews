**Will the applications be evaluated on a rolling basis or will they all be reviewed once the application window closes?**

Applications will be reviewed by a panel of experts once the application window closes on August 11. After that, there will be a follow-up round of questions to a smaller semi-finalist pool. Finalists will be interviewed, and Fellows will be announced at the Mozilla Festival in November.
