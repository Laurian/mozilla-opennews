*What made you want to become a Knight-Mozilla Fellow?*

Call me a hippie but I really believe that you can change the world through media and so I felt the intersection of news and technology is a very exciting place to work. Also I was insanely curious to find out how a news organization functioned, oh and the challenges to be solved can be extremely interesting and potential solutions could be seen, used and importantly tested on a worldwide audience.


*What unique skills do you think you bring into the newsroom?*

I work a lot with web-based audio and video. I guess we all have our own unique blend of abilities - ah maybe the ability to smell good coffee at 100 yards? Does that count?


*What do you think the role of the technologist/developer is in journalism today?*

I think one of the principle roles is to convince journalists to look towards the web for inspiration, use the tools that it provides and to keep on learning from it because things are changing apace.


*How do you think journalism is transforming?*

It is becoming much more immediate and participatory. Anybody can contribute and see their contribution go global in a matter of minutes. In fact one of the challenges is to properly harness user-generated content.

*What made you want to become a Knight-Mozilla Fellow?*

Reading others' submissions to the challenge made me more aware on how I interact with the news, what I dislike and what I felt I was missing (as tool) for making sense of the news, and I ended up submitting my own idea.

*What unique skills do you think you bring into the newsroom?*

I've always worked as a mediator between designers and programmers and doing the R&D needed to bridge the gap between concept and implementation, between magic and actual tricks. And I do know some tricks in the natural language processing, semantic web and HCI areas.

*What do you think the role of the technologist/developer is in journalism today?*

To liberate the journalists from the CMS!

*How do you think journalism is transforming?*

The reader is transforming, â€¦ TODO
